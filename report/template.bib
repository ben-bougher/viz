  abstract =   "In this state-of-the-art report we discuss relevant research
               works related to the visualization of complex, multivariate
               data. We discuss how different techniques take effect at
               specific stages of the visualization pipeline and how they
               apply to multi-variate data sets being composed of scalars,
               vectors and tensors. We also provide a categorization of
               these techniques with the aim for a better overview of
               related approaches. Based on this classification we
               highlight combinable and hybrid approaches and focus on
               techniques that potentially lead towards new directions in
               visualization research. In the second part of this paper we
               take a look at recent techniques that are useful for the
               visualization of complex data sets either because they are
               general purpose or because they can be adapted to specific
               problems.",
